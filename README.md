This is a boilerplate to easily get started with [Sophia](https://docs.aeternity.com/aesophia) Smart Contract development using [aeproject](https://docs.aeternity.com/aeproject).

You can simply use this template to start your own Smart Contract project by forking it. You can then choose between:
- Cloning the repo and running it locally on your machine
- Use "Open in Gitpod" (note: adjust the repository URL in the README after forking the repo!)
    - This will automatically execute `aeproject env` to spawn the local development environment
    - By executing `aeproject test` or `npm run test` you can execute the default test localted under `./test/exampleTest.js`

# Happy coding! =)
